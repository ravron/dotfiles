# git send-email uses perl, but requires additional perl modules. Further, git
# doesn't require the perl brew formula, and won't use the brewed perl unless
# you pass --with-perl. Thus:
#   1. Install brew's perl
#   2. Use brewed perl's cpan to install the three required modules for
#      send-email.
#   3. Install git and use --with-perl to point it at the brewed perl.
# See https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/12870 for further
# information.
# aaand the interactive.singleKey config requires Term::ReadKey, which
# apparently doesn't come standard with the brew perl. Maybe this isn't worth it
# just to get send-email working.
